Notes:

- 4 hour max. More than that and we're being disrespectful towards people's time.

- The candidate should be given an opportunity to discuss their solution. In real-life code, a seemingly stupid decision is may well be totally justifiable, but not obviously so from the code itself.

- The candidate always gets an explanation of why they were rejected. It's easy to say "your skills are not a good fit at this time", but it's hard to tell someone you don't know what's wrong with something they put a lot of work into. It's still worth doing.
